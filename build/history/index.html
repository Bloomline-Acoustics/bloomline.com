    <p>I believe that Omniwave is a major milestone in the history of sound reproduction, more profound than the invention of the electrostatic loudspeaker or multi-channel audio.</p>
    <p>Omniwave is the life's work of Leo de Klerk, who started his career as a pianist and composer. Later he founded Bloomline Studio and became a recording producer. At the time of his invention, Leo and I were working together as producers in our partnership firm Bloomline Coryphée.</p>
    <p>As we spent long hours in the control and editing rooms, we got tired of being glued to the "sweet spot" between our studio monitors. It was only at that particular spot that one could get some sense of the dimensions of the space and the place of the performers. Even the tiniest movement of the head would distort that perception in a way that greatly distracted from the performance.</p>
    <p>Even though this was a known issue with all loudspeakers, Leo thought that there had to be a solution. As he felt that any solution would have to be based on a coherent sound source, he started to experiment with coaxial and inverted cone loudspeakers. Even the early results were convincing enough for me to sacrife my beloved B&amp;W Matrix 80s to these experiments, which shows just how much my curiosity was piqued!</p>
    <p>Later, Leo developed new drivers, casings, and cross-over filters, and conducted research that led to completely new insights into the principles of human hearing. After years of research and experimentation, he invented Omniwave, the only loudspeaker in the world that can accurately reproduce the spatial dimensions of an acoustial recording.</p>
    <p>I vividly remember the complete shock of hearing Omniwave for the first time. Here was a loudspeaker that projected an entire soundstage outside itself, and allowed you to walk around in it. I could literally not believe my ears.</p>
    <p>The road from prototype to patent and manufactured product was a long one. The challenge in patenting Omniwave was that it was not one but several steps ahead of the prior art. Its working principles were based on ideas that weren't generally understood. Human hearing as an object-oriented system, shape related transfer functions, the role of the <i>pinna</i> and tiny head movements in spatial hearing, there was a lot of ground to cover. Writing the Omniwave patent took Leo years of hard work. The same applied to designing drivers that could be manufactured at scale within the narrow tolerances that Omniwave requires.</p>
    <p>By the time of Leo's passing away, Omniwave was being used at prestiguous events and locations like Google I/O, the Netherlands Houses of Parliament, and the Philharmonie in Berlin. Fortunately, he has been able to witness the breakthrough of his invention.</p>
    <p>Leo was a truly exceptional human being, and his genius cannot be replaced. But Leo's spirit lives on in Omniwave, his great gift to music lovers all over the world.</p>
