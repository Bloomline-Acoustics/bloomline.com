    <p>I believe that Omniwave is one of the great milestones in the history of sound reproduction, more profound than the invention of the electrostatic loudspeaker or multi-channel audio.</p>
    <p>At the time of the invention, Leo de Klerk and I were working together as recording producers in our partnership firm, Bloomline Coryph√©e.</p>
    <p>We spent long hours in the control and editing rooms, glued to the "sweet spot" between our studio monitors. It was only at that particular spot that one could hear a believable reproduction of what was happening on the stage. Even the tiniest movement of the head broke that illusion and caused comb filter effects.</p>
    <p>Even though this was a known issue with all loudspeakers, Leo thought that there had to be a solution. He strongly felt that that solution had to include omnidirectional units, and so he started off by making a set of old Philips MFB 22RH541 more or less omnidirectional by inverting their cones and disabling their tweeters. Naturally they sounded dull that way, but what was interesting was that they produced a more stable and accurate sound stage.</p>
    <p>It didn't take long for Leo to invert the cones of all the dynamic loudspeakers in our arsenal. I even sacrificed my beloved B&W Matrix 805s to the experiment, which goes to show how much my curiosity was piqued.</p>
    <p>The next step was to put a tweeter inside the woofer. Obviously, the KEF Uni-Q coaxial driver was a prime candidate for the experiment, as all we needed to do was to invert the woofer, then the tweeter inside it. The result was a great improvement, but it wasn't perfect: the comb filter effects were still there.</p>
    <p>Leo experimented with playing back pink noise over a set of inverted Uni-Qs, and tried them at different angles. Then came the lightning bolt. He rotated <em>one</em> of the speakers so that both drivers were perpendicular to each other in a 45-degree angle from the listener. We were astounded: the comb filter effects were gone. What was happening here?</p>
    <p>Leo then turned the configuration upright to see if it would create a vertical phantom image of a monaural source. It did. Even in mono, the sound image seemed to come loose from the loudspeakers, and the sweet spot was gone, or it was everywhere. Leo had created a virtual loudspeaker.</p>
    <p>Naturally, Leo quickly made a stereo pair of this vertical arrangement. The effect was astounding: the loudspeakers seemed to have all but disappeared. The space of any acoustical recording was depicted with uncanny accuracy, and one could freely move around in it. Omniwave was born.</p>
    <p>In the following years, Leo kept working on a theory of Omniwave's working principles, developed dedicated loudspeaker units and casings, and patented the invention, while getting listeners and audiences in Europe and the United States acquainted with the closest approximation to accurate 3-dimensional stereo known to humankind.</p>
    <p>In his ongoing research, the <em>coherence</em> of reproduced sound appeared to be key, and a lot of effort went into developing dedicated drivers, casings, and crossover filters.</p>
    <p>The challenge in patenting Omniwave was that it was not one but several steps ahead of the prior art. Its working principle solved problems that weren't generally accepted or even fully understood. Human hearing as an object-oriented system, shape related transfer functions, the role of the <i>pinna</i> and tiny head movements in spatial hearing, there was a lot of ground to cover. Writing the Omniwave patent took years of hard work.</p>
    <p>By the time of Leo's passing away, Omniwave was being used at prestiguous events and locations like Google I/O, the Netherlands Houses of Parliament, and the Philharmonie in Berlin. Fortunately he has been able to witness the success of his invention.</p>
    <p>Leo was a truly exceptional human being, and his genius cannot be replaced. But Leo's spirit lives on in Omniwave, his great gift to music lovers all over the world.</p>
